I am a theoretical physicist working at the interface between cosmology, quantum field theory, quantum many-body systems, and quantum information. 

A large part of my work focuses on the study of pair creation phenomena in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, in particular as a dark matter production mechanism during the early Universe. At the same time, I have investigated the simulation of quantum field dynamics in analogue gravity setups, primarily in Bose-Einstein condensates and trapped-ion systems. This has allowed me to study properties of quantum fields such as entanglement or quantisation ambiguities, from different perspectives. 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the group of Prof. Torsten Bringmann at the University of Oslo. We aim to characterise non-thermal dark matter production from both gravitational and a particle physics perspectives, employing tools from both fields.
